description: "I am a born and bred Dubliner, brought up in the lovely Southside Surburb of Ballinteer. I came from a working class family of 7 including the 2 most amazing parents any son (or daughters) could have asked for..Although we didn't want for anything, like most families we had a fair share of ups and downs during childhood and into our early adulthood. Indeed some of these downs where truly tragic, none worse than the loss of my beloved earth angel and eldest sister Elaine from Cancer. She really was an angel on earth although for far too short-lived a life (29). Indeed that year saw a further tragedy of losing the first grandchild (my nephew Jamie) for one of my other sisters. A truly devastating and life-changing year."

I am a born and bred Dubliner, brought up in the lovely Southside Surburb of Ballinteer. I came from a working class family of 7 including the 2 most amazing parents any son (or daughters) could have asked for..Although we didn't want for anything, like most families we had a fair share of ups and downs during childhood and into our early adulthood. Indeed some of these downs where truly tragic, none worse than the loss of my beloved earth angel and eldest sister Elaine from Cancer. She really was an angel on earth although for far too short-lived a life (29). Indeed that year saw a further tragedy of losing the first grandchild (my nephew Jamie) for one of my other sisters. A truly devastating and life-changing year.

I mentioned these tragedies, because it was from these, that I realised one of my main passions was educating myself about health & wellbeing. More importantly, how to help tragedies like this from not happening again. Little was I to know, but this was to be tested and so evident in just a few years after the loss of my sister and nephew. During Elaines battle and fight for life, I studied holistic therapies including Energy Healing. This was the become one of the most important decisions I made as I know now it was a major part of my purpose in life. To help people to heal themselves naturally and to understand how to achieve Total Wellbeing (The state and moment when everything works perfectly inside and outside your body - perfect balance and harmony with the universe) !!

My Mothers diagnosis of Cancer, not once but a second time a few years later was just too much to bear for us all...I was particularly close to her as was my sister Elaine. I made a decision that it was 100% NOT happening to my Mum aswell. I dreaded to even have one thought what would happen to us  (especially my Father, Tony) if we lost her too....So, I used this deep deep desire and my knowledge I learned from healing and wellbeing up to then and went to work. 3 months later, after a scan, the doctors where baffled but of course delighted..Nothing like my/our joy of course. The Natural healing had really worked. No one knew exactly how, not even me at the time, but who cared..My Mother was going to survive..And she is still here 10 years on fighting and winning the battle.

This positive life-changing experience pushed me forward to use the gifts I was given. Miraculously there where to be more amazing survival stories and experiences for people I was guided to help. To this day, it is just mind-blowing but again, the most important thing is they are still here to tell the tale...Alive and Living Life like never before...

My passion for healing drove me to also educate myself and qualify in other areas related to Health & Wellbeing - Personal & Group Fitness; Life Coaching & Personal Development, Healthy Organic Eating; Natural Remedies, NLP & The Power of the Mind and more.
