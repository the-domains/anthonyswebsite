            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am a born and bred Dubliner, brought up in the lovely Southside Surburb of Ballinteer. I came from a working class family of 7 including the 2 most amazing parents any son (or daughters) could have asked for..Although we didn't want for anything, like most families we had a fair share of ups and downs during childhood and into our early adulthood. Indeed some of these downs where truly tragic, none worse than the loss of my beloved earth angel and eldest sister Elaine from Cancer. She really was an angel on earth although for far too short-lived a life (29). Indeed that year saw a further tragedy of losing the first grandchild (my nephew Jamie) for one of my other sisters. A truly devastating and life-changing year.</p>]]></description>
